The sad fact is that every day people all around us are waging their own private war with fear, pain and loneliness. The list includes but is certainly not limited to shut-ins, disabled, elderly, military personnel and those who have lost loved ones. Millions more are fighting devastating physical or mental illness.`,

      `Love Transfusion, Inc. was founded by a group of people who have experienced some of life’s darkest moment’s first-hand… and want to help others in their time of need.
      
    What makes Love Transfusion unique?
    
    Although there are a few sites designed to keep friends and loved ones informed of an individual’s medical situation, none effectively provide a means of communicating love and support back to the person or family in need. Studies have shown that patients who feel love and support heal more quickly. The same can be said for individuals facing virtually any difficult situation.
    
    Love Transfusion is about people helping people. We believe the most important things in life are relationships. If we can facilitate those relationships, serve as a conduit between those in need and those who care… together we can help each other through even the most difficult times.
    
    Love Transfusion is private – We give users full control over the amount of information they share… and with whom they share it. Recipients can manage details of their situation with privacy settings, thereby allowing those closest to them greater access, yet still provide some limited information for even complete strangers who wish to express support.
    
    Love Transfusion is free – There is no cost to use the service. A website can be set-up for you or a loved one in a matter of minutes.
    
    Love Transfusion is easy – Anyone with an Internet connection can use it.
    
    Love Transfusion recommends quality resources – We have trained professionals on staff who research and recommend the best resources for each individual’s specific needs.`,

    description: `In the fall of 2007, I had an emergency appendectomy. Although the procedure went fine, tests revealed other symptoms which were “suggestive of metastatic disease” (Stage IV cancer). Two weeks later, radiologists at a separate medical facility came to the same conclusion, with test results “suggesting metastatic disease”. Although not an official diagnosis, from my perspective, it looked grim.`,
    meta: [
      `Fortunately, after several months of tests and scans, doctors determined I was cancer-free. All that remained were multiple non-calcified nodules scattered throughout both lungs.

      Those months were the most difficult of my life. They also gave me a new perspective into what goes through the mind of someone facing life’s darkest moments.
      
      Some of my clearest memories were, in moments of despair, of making my way to my computer in the middle of the night – hoping to see a message from someone. Fortunately for me, I am blessed with an extended network of family and friends. And over those months, many reached out with compassion, hope and love.
      
      In the years that followed, I have had a burning desire to help others in the midst of similar battles. Some bravely, some with anxiety – and some in great fear. Regardless of the situation, there is something we can all do to infuse a degree of hope and peace back into these people’s lives… and that is simply to let them know we are there and that we care.`,

    Our goal is to serve as a conduit and facilitating expressions of love and support.

      `Love Transfusion provides simple, safe and effective ways for people to communicate support and encouragement to those who are hurting – whether they be family, friend or even a complete stranger.

      For the first time in history, because of the Internet and mobile devices, we now have the ability to instantaneously connect those who hurt with those who care. Clinical studies have shown that individuals who know they are being thought of and prayed for – heal faster, better and stronger. When actual visits in person are not logistically possible for whatever reason, just the knowledge of a connection with someone, regardless of distance… provides a tremendous source of comfort.`,

Although a tremendous repository of information, search engines are not the best place for people under a lot of stress to get expert advice – for the simple reason that search engine results are not sorted by order of credentials.
